Dear Parth,

Thank you so much for teaching us in this quarter. You always make the section content vivid, and I am really
impressed by your style. I love the snacks you bought for us, which made me feel ralexed and encouraged
before the exam. I am thankful for your generous help and suggestions on each of my assignment. You
are a great teacher.

Best,
Liu
